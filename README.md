# pong-with-multiversal-instability
Final project for CMPSC 457. Pong where each round has a modifier themed after a graphics algorithm.

The goal is to include the following algorithms somehow, as well as basic Pong:
* Translation, rotation, and scaling by matrices
* Lighting equations
* Shaders (RGB gamer lights and textures)
* Bezier curve
