# PONG WITH MULTIVERSAL INSTABILITY
Final project for CMPSC 457. Pong where each round has a modifier themed after a graphics algorithm.

How to run:
Load the project into Visual Studio or run the .exe file in "\pong-with-multiversal-instability\Pong with Multiversal Instability\x64\Debug"
Run the Pong.cpp file
Left click to select game mode on title screen

Control scheme:
W & S to move Paddle 1 (Left paddle)
Up Arrow & Down Arrow to move Paddle 2 (Right paddle, on Player vs. Player mode)
M to cycle through modifiers
R to reset the game after a point, and select a random modifier
P to pause
Esc to exit to title screen, then Esc again 

The goal is to include the following algorithms somehow, as well as basic Pong:
* Translation, rotation, and scaling by matrices
* Lighting equations
* Shaders (RGB gamer lights and textures)
* Bezier curve
